# About YO-YO Test
The Yo-Yo test was invented by Dr. Jens Bangsbo, a Danish scientist and football coach, 
in the 1990s. He tested it on footballers to improve their overall fitness levels, with a routine that was not just about running long distances. 
Gradually, other sport started adopting Yo-Yo. For elite footballers, the benchmark score was set high at 21. 

This test is basically a variation of the Beep test which is a running aerobic fitness routine. This is a gruelling routine and has two sets of cones which are 
placed 20 metres apart. Once the beep is sounded, an athlete has to reach the marker on the other side by the time the next beep shrieks. 
He then has to turn around and rush back to mark from where he started the run.

The frequency of the beeps keeps on increasing with every round - and a player is considered to be successful in the test after they finish the run to the cone and back.
There is a gap of about seven seconds between each trip.
The test starts with a player kicking off his jog at a speed of level 5, which consists of one shuttle. Subsequently, the next speed level, which is 9, 
also consists of one shuttle. The next speed level is 11 and this has two shuttles while level 12 has three and level 13 four. There are eight shuttles per level from 14 upwards.

In the existing form, level 23 is the highest speed level in a yo-yo test. It should be mentioned here that each shuttle covers a distance of 40 metres and hence, 
the total distance is an aggregate of distance covered at every speed level.

The player in the routine gets ten seconds to recover between two shuttles. Also, he will keep a first warning at any point when he fails to reach the first cone.
